# App Assistant output contract

## Contents

- Output-mode selection
- Concise delivery report
- Structured AppAssistantResult contract
- Cross-field consistency rules
- Human-readable section requirements

  ## Output Format

  Result model and presentation modes:

  - this skill must emit `AppAssistantResult`
  - minimum target fields:
    - `project`
    - `environment`
    - `request_intent`
    - `execution_path`
    - `orchestration_state`
    - `runtime_state`
    - `delivery_state`
    - `actions_performed`
    - `next_action`
  - optional extension field:
    - `promotion_result`
  - `AppAssistantResult` is always the internal result model for routing, validation, and downstream automation
  - the user-facing reply has two presentation modes:
    - concise delivery report mode
    - structured contract mode

  ### Customer report mode

  Use this mode by default for successful, incomplete, blocked, ambiguous, and handoff results. Switch away from it only when the user explicitly requests structured output, YAML, JSON, debug details, or machine-readable output, or when an automation/evaluation consumer explicitly declares the structured contract requirement.

  First read the [generated user-result policy](generated/user-result.md), then apply the App Assistant-specific fields and terminal wording below.

## 交流群结束卡片

顶层终端用户结果需要收尾时，读取 [generated Community Card](generated/community-card.md) 并严格按其适用条件和固定内容执行；本会话只读取一次，不得复制、改写或在中间结果中展示。

  In customer report mode:
  - do not append `### Structured Output`
  - do not expose the fenced YAML block
  - successful body contains only one result line plus one `应用`, `状态`, and verified `地址` field
  - incomplete body contains only one `状态`, one `阻塞`, and at most one `下一步` field
  - omit unavailable fields instead of guessing or duplicating them in prose
  - do not append a fixed next-actions list unless the user explicitly asks for options
  - emit progress only on a state change or after 30 seconds without a visible message
  - do not expose orchestration enums, lower-level skill names, `Blocking Issue: none`, or the internal action ledger

  Default success shape (the public URL is an example only; a real reply must use the exact verified gateway value from Iron Law 40):

  ```markdown
  部署成功
  应用：demo-2048
  状态：running
  地址：http://example.invalid/2048
  ```

  Default incomplete shape:

  ```markdown
  部署未完成
  状态：building
  阻塞：镜像拉取失败
  下一步：修复镜像地址后重新部署
  ```

  ### Structured contract mode

  Use this mode when any of the following is true:
  - the user asks for structured output, YAML, JSON, debug details, or machine-readable output
  - an eval, wrapper, or automation flow explicitly needs deterministic structured schema validation
  - another skill or wrapper will consume the result as input

  Building, unhealthy, blocked, ambiguous, handoff, and incomplete promotion states do not enable structured mode by themselves. In customer mode, explain the direct result and one actionable next step in concise Chinese without exposing internal enums or action ledgers.

  In structured contract mode:
  - the human-readable sections below are the narrative view over `AppAssistantResult`
  - the explicitly structured reply ends with a final `### Structured Output` section
  - the `### Structured Output` section must render `AppAssistantResult` in fenced `yaml`
  - the literal section order must be:
    - `### Project State`
    - `### Actions Performed`
    - `### Current Health`
    - `### Blocking Issue`
    - `### Next Step`
    - `### Structured Output`
  - each heading above must be rendered literally, including the leading `###`
  - headings such as `Project State` without `###`, translated heading labels, or `Structured Output` without the exact heading marker are contract failures
  - the fenced `yaml` block must appear immediately under `### Structured Output`
  - omitting the final structured block, changing its object name, or placing later prose after it is a contract failure

  Proposed schema:

  ```yaml

  Construction rules:

  - `project.identity`
    - comes from the resolved current-run identity after applying explicit input, local binding, and manifest context
  - `project.linked`
    - must reflect whether current-run context confirms a linked project state
    - do not force `false` only because local metadata is stale when the platform confirms the same bound app in the current run
  - `project.selected_environment`
    - must match the resolved environment for the current run
  - `project.deployment_location_url`
    - must always be present and may be `null` when trusted Console base or resolved identity is unavailable
    - when non-null, must be built from trusted Console base plus the URL-encoded team, region, and app ID overview route from Iron Law 41
    - must never be copied from or inferred from `delivery_state.preferred_access_url`
  - `environment`
    - must describe the selected environment and whether env/secrets layers are present enough to matter to orchestration
  - `request_intent`
    - must normalize whether the run is only for the source app or explicitly asks for the dev-to-test promotion flow
  - `execution_path`
    - must preserve the requested and resolved delivery path
    - if the run is source-backed, `resolved_kind` must stay `source` unless the user explicitly changed delivery mode
  - `orchestration_state`
    - remains the workflow label used by the assistant
  - `runtime_state.phase`
    - must use canonical runtime labels
    - use `source_build_failed` when a source-backed build or source detection has failed and the run is handing off to the troubleshooter on the same source path; this is the canonical phase for the source-build-first routing of Iron Law 6 (source-backed failure routes to troubleshooter, never to package/image/template fallback)
    - in `source_build_failed`, `delivery_state` must stay `null` and `next_action` must point to a troubleshooter recommendation (the `run troubleshooter on the same source path` vocabulary entry)
  - `runtime_state.db_status`, `api_status`, `frontend_status`
    - must be based on current runtime evidence when available
    - must use the canonical vocabulary `building`, `waiting`, `running`, `abnormal`, or `capacity-blocked`
    - map statuses by actual role presence rather than filling every lane mechanically
    - for frontend-only or docs-style projects, keep `api_status = null` unless a real service/API component exists
    - for service-only projects with no user-facing frontend component, keep `frontend_status = null` unless a real frontend/access component exists
    - do not emit raw platform labels such as `closed` as component status; translate them to the closest canonical status from the same evidence
    - if raw status is `closed`, `closed` is never allowed in the canonical field
    - raw `closed` or `undeploy` plus active unschedulable CPU/memory evidence maps to `capacity-blocked`
    - raw `closed` plus crash, probe, dependency, image-pull, or other runtime failure evidence maps to `abnormal`
    - raw app-level labels must not override stronger current component-level evidence
  - `runtime_state.blocker`
    - must capture the dominant unresolved blocker when one exists
    - prefer the blocker supported by current-run platform truth over stale historical events when they disagree
  - `delivery_state`
    - may be `null` if delivery verifier has not run yet
    - must remain `null` when this run stopped before entering `rainbond-delivery-verifier`
    - must always describe the source app only, even when testing-app promotion later succeeds
    - should relay the lower-level delivery-verifier result instead of inventing a separate top-level delivery taxonomy
  - `promotion_result`
    - must remain `null` unless the user explicitly asked for development-to-testing promotion
    - must describe snapshot and testing-app outcomes without replacing the source-app meaning of the top-level `project`
    - must only be populated automatically after strict `delivery_state.status = delivered`
    - should advance monotonically through `snapshot_created` -> `testing_app_created` -> `testing_app_verified`, or stop at `blocked`
  - `actions_performed`
    - should list the lower-level skills actually invoked or explicitly skipped when relevant to the next step
    - if no lower-level skill was run, still record the inspection/classification pass and any intentionally skipped downstream skills that matter to the recommendation
  - `next_action`
    - must be the normalized form of the prose next-step recommendation
    - **must be selected from the canonical `next_action` vocabulary below.** Fixed phrases are used verbatim; template phrases keep the literal words and only fill the `<...>` slots. Do not invent free-form wording — the vocabulary exists to keep the orchestration contract phrase-stable across runs.

  #### Canonical `next_action` vocabulary

  Fixed phrases — emit exactly as written, no slots, no rewording:

  | Phrase | When |
  |--------|------|
  | `stop` | terminal state with nothing further to recommend (already delivered, or a clean stop) |
  | `run bootstrap` | topology is missing and the source app must be created/bootstrapped next |
  | `run project init in adopt/link mode, then continue to bootstrap` | a local workspace/package has a verified existing platform app but lacks a complete local manifest/binding pair |
  | `run troubleshooter` | topology is building/unhealthy and the next bounded step is the troubleshooter |
  | `run troubleshooter on the same source path` | a source-backed build/detection failed; route to the troubleshooter on the same source path, never to a package/image/template fallback (pairs with `runtime_state.phase = source_build_failed`) |
  | `run delivery verifier` | runtime looks healthy and the next step is delivery verification |
  | `fix cluster capacity first` | the dominant blocker is cluster capacity and it must be resolved before anything else |
  | `handoff to code/build agent` | the run reached `code_or_build_handoff_needed`; hand off to the code/build agent |
  | `stop and validate URL manually` | delivery ended `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`; user must validate the URL manually |
  | `stop and ask the user to choose the team/app identity` | identity is ambiguous; stop and ask the user to pick the team/app |
  | `stop and ask the user to provide a descriptor or template` | a complex multi-service suite needs a descriptor/template before continuing |
  | `build the linked source app on the user-provided GitHub URL` | an explicit Git URL locks the source path; build the linked source app on that URL |
  | `configure ports and envs on the known service_alias from the create return` | the service alias is already known from the create return; configure ports/envs on it next |

  Template phrases — keep the literal words, fill only the `<...>` slot(s):

  | Template | Slot(s) | When |
  |----------|---------|------|
  | `stop after reporting testing app verification for <app>` | `<app>` = testing app name | dev-to-test promotion finished; stop after reporting the testing app verification |
  | `delete the abandoned half-installed template app <app> before building the source path` | `<app>` = abandoned app name (omit the slot, leaving `... template app before ...`, if no concrete name applies) | a strategy switch left a half-installed template app that must be cleaned up before building the source path |

  > **修改需同步**：这张词表是 `next_action` 的唯一权威来源。`scripts/validate_app_assistant_output.py` 里的 `CANONICAL_NEXT_ACTIONS` / `CANONICAL_NEXT_ACTION_TEMPLATES` 必须与本表保持一致；改一处必须改另一处。

  Consistency rules:

  - `orchestration_state` and `runtime_state.phase` may differ in wording but must not conflict semantically
  - if current-run platform evidence confirms the app exists and the dominant blocker is runtime/platform capacity, do not downgrade the project to unlinked solely because local metadata still says `pending_verification`
  - do not classify the project as `capacity_blocked` based only on old `Unschedulable` events when current node capacity and current app/component state indicate another blocker is now dominant
  - if app-level runtime labels say `closed` but current component evidence shows active capacity scheduling failure, canonical component status must still be `capacity-blocked`
  - only use `abnormal` for raw `closed` when no stronger canonical state can be supported from current evidence
  - if the app is still `part_running` due to a critical capacity blocker, `next_action` must not point to delivery verification
  - if `runtime_state.phase = source_build_failed`, `delivery_state` must be `null` and `next_action` must point to a troubleshooter recommendation; never fall back to package/image/template
  - if delivery verifier has not run, do not invent a non-null delivery outcome
  - if the run stopped during `project-init`, `bootstrap`, or `troubleshooter`, `delivery_state` must be `null`
  - if the source app is runtime-healthy enough that the remaining issue is outer access or final URL selection, prefer `linked-and-needs-delivery-verification` over `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy`
  - for reverse-proxy full-stack apps, do not treat a frontend root URL alone as a trustworthy final outcome if the same-host backend path is still unverified or failing
  - if a component was resolved as source-backed earlier in the same run, do not silently rewrite the reasoning as image-backed after a source-create or source-build failure
  - if a source ref was resolved earlier in the same run, do not silently rewrite it to another branch
  - do not treat missing optional source-create passthrough fields such as `check_uuid` or `event_id` as a blocker unless the backend explicitly requires them
  - if source detection reports multiple services/components, do not automatically pivot into local package, local build, manual upload, or template-install workaround flows without explicit user confirmation
  - if a GitHub source URL is still raw `https://github.com/...`, the assistant may ask once whether to use `https://ghfast.top/https://github.com/...` or `https://gh.rainbond.cc/https://github.com/...`, but must not silently rewrite the Git URL without either explicit user input or a repo-local proxy URL already present
  - transport hints for registry or Git mirrors must not be treated as a delivery-mode override unless the user explicitly asked to switch to image deployment
  - external artifact download failures, image layer pull timeouts, Docker Hub timeouts, and GitHub Release asset download failures should be reported as `external artifact unreachable` when that is the dominant evidence
  - if bootstrap reports `platform backend issue`, do not classify the result as `linked-and-needs-code-handoff`; stop with the source app still incomplete and report the backend capability failure explicitly
  - if `delivery_state.status = delivered-but-needs-manual-validation`, `promotion_result` must stay `null` and `next_action` must not auto-enter version flow
  - if runtime logs show hard-coded dependency coordinates such as `db`, but current dependency wiring provides provider connection envs or alias-based connection envs, prefer provider connection contract repair, then compatibility-env troubleshooting, over accepting the hard-coded value as authoritative
  - if `promotion_result` is non-null, `delivery_state.status` must already be `delivered`
  - if `promotion_result.testing_delivery_state` is non-null, `promotion_result.testing_app.app_id` must also be non-null
  - for frontend-only or docs-style projects, do not mirror the same frontend component status into `api_status`
  - do not upgrade top-level `delivery_state` from `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation` to `delivered` only because the testing app later verified successfully
  - if testing-app verification ends in `blocked` or `partially-delivered`, `next_action` should point to troubleshooting the testing app rather than re-running the whole mainline
  - no secret values may appear in the structured object

  Example final reply:

  ````markdown
  ### Project State
  The project is `linked-and-topology-present-but-runtime-unhealthy` for the `preview` environment with team `alpha-org`, region `us-south`, app `storefront`, and app_id `92`.

  ### Actions Performed
  `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter` completed and identified converged API/DB components while the frontend stayed abnormal, prompting a focus on nginx host configuration; `rainbond-delivery-verifier` was skipped because runtime health remains outstanding.

  ### Current Health
  db status running, api/service status running, frontend-access status abnormal, overall status runtime_unhealthy.

  ### Blocking Issue
  frontend waiting on corrected nginx host config.

  ### Next Step
  run troubleshooter.

  ### Structured Output
  ```yaml
  AppAssistantResult:
    project:
      identity:
        team_name: alpha-org
        region_name: us-south

  Only in explicit structured contract mode, respond using exactly these sections:

  ### Project State
  - state the current classification
  - explicitly include the exact `orchestration_state` label in prose, preferably in backticks
  - include selected environment
  - include resolved team, region, app, and app_id if available

  ### Actions Performed
  - list the lower-level skill(s) used
  - summarize what each one did
  - if no lower-level skill was executed, say that this run only performed context resolution and state classification
  - if a downstream skill was intentionally not entered because the user asked not to continue yet, say that explicitly
  - if development-to-testing promotion was entered, explicitly name the source delivery gate, snapshot creation, testing-app creation, and testing-app verification stages
  - if source creation failed, say so explicitly instead of describing the resulting component as if it had always been image-backed
  - if source creation failed because of a control-plane exception, say that this is a platform backend issue rather than code/build failure
  - if the source ref or branch was invalid, say that explicitly instead of auto-rewriting it

  ### Current Health
  Explicitly report:
  - **db status** using `building`, `waiting`, `running`, `abnormal`, or `capacity-blocked` when runtime evidence is available
  - **api/service status** using `building`, `waiting`, `running`, `abnormal`, or `capacity-blocked` when runtime evidence is available
  - **frontend-access status**
  - **overall status** using the canonical runtime or delivery term when one is available
  - explicitly include the exact `runtime_state.phase` label in prose, preferably in backticks
  - if the platform reports a raw label such as `closed`, explain it in prose if useful, but normalize the status field itself to the canonical vocabulary

  ### Blocking Issue
  - state the main blocker if the app is not fully healthy
  - when `runtime_state.blocker` or `delivery_state.blocker` is non-null, reuse that blocker sentence verbatim in plain text so prose and structured output stay aligned
  - do not wrap part of the blocker sentence in backticks or paraphrase only part of it
  - if none, say `none`
  - if the source app is healthy but the testing app blocked during promotion, state the testing-app blocker here
  - if the source app only lacks an external access URL, describe that as a delivery/access-path blocker rather than generic runtime failure

  ### Next Step
  - state the single most appropriate next action
  - examples:
    - `run env sync`
    - `run bootstrap`
    - `run troubleshooter`
    - `manual URL validation before promotion`
    - `create snapshot and testing app`
    - `run troubleshooter on testing app`
    - `stop, hand off testing app to human testers`
    - `handoff to code/build agent`
    - `stop, app is healthy`

  ### Structured Output
  - append a fenced `yaml` block as the final section
  - render `AppAssistantResult`
  - keep enum values and field names aligned with the schema above
  - if `runtime_state` or `delivery_state` is unavailable, use `null` rather than guessing
  - if post-delivery promotion was not entered, use `promotion_result: null`
  - do not place any prose after this section
  - the heading itself must be exactly `### Structured Output`
  - the opening fence must be exactly ````yaml` immediately after the heading
  - the closing fence must be the last non-whitespace line of the whole reply
