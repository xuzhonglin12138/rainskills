# Workflow and Convergence

- Read when: you are about to execute bootstrap, resume a partial run, or reason about dependency deferral and source convergence.
- Do not read when: you only need scope fitting or the final reply format.
- Depends on: [10-context-loading.md](10-context-loading.md), [30-creation-rules.md](30-creation-rules.md), [40-source-and-package-rules.md](40-source-and-package-rules.md) when source/package components are involved.
- Produces: the ordered execution plan, dependency-deferral decisions, and runtime-inspection sequence.

## Mainline Summary

Bootstrap follows this high-level flow:
1. read manifest, binding, env, and secrets
2. confirm the target app exists
3. create components in dependency-aware order
4. apply minimum ports, dependencies, and startup config
5. deploy affected components
6. inspect runtime evidence
7. decide whether to stop, hand off, or finish bootstrap

## Detailed Execution Order

Follow this order.

### 1. Resolve context and selected environment

- collect any user-explicit identifiers, environment choice, component overrides, or env overrides first
- read `.rainbond/local.json` if present for bound `team_name`, `region_name`, `app_name`, `app_id`, platform server, and `preferences.default_environment`
- if `.rainbond/local.json.runtime_components` exists, load it as a reuse hint for later role-to-runtime matching
- select the environment file with this order: user explicit input > `.rainbond/local.json.preferences.default_environment` > `preview`
- read `.rainbond/secrets.<environment>.json` if present and extract component-level secret env values
- read the selected `.rainbond/env.<environment>.json` if present and extract environment-layer component env overrides
- read `rainbond.app.json`; if absent, read legacy `rainbond.json` as the same lowest-priority baseline tier
- parse and validate `schema_version` for whichever baseline file is used
- merge app identity, topology, and env intent using the configuration-priority rules
- if `included_components` or `excluded_components` is present, compute the filtered execution set
- ask the user only for values still missing after all configured layers are resolved

### 2. Ensure app exists

- find the target app
- create it if missing
- if the app already exists, query current component data through Rainbond Tools first and use `.rainbond/local.json.runtime_components` only as a hint to align logical roles to existing runtime components before deciding whether to reuse or create resources

### 3. Ensure provider components exist

For executable database and middleware provider components such as databases, caches, brokers, and queues:
- if image-backed, create from manifest if missing
- if source-backed, create from source if explicitly supported
- if package-backed, create from local package path if explicitly supported
- if template-backed, skip and record that template installation must be handled upstream

Then:
- ensure startup env exists for the provider itself
- ensure the provider inner port is configured
- normalize provider port aliases when `port_alias` or a clear convention is available
- configure provider-side connection envs with `rainbond_manage_component_connection_envs`
- for stateful middleware providers, inspect component storage and ensure a durable volume is mounted at the known data directory before deploy/restart; use `rainbond_manage_component_storage` for the storage summary, volume creation, and mount creation path
- if stateful middleware storage cannot be created, record the persistence caveat immediately and do not present the component as production-safe

### 4. Ensure service components exist

- create services from manifest if missing
- proceed in dependency order
- for source-backed services, use source creation instead of image creation
- for package-backed services, use package upload instead of image creation
- for template-backed services, skip and report them as non-bootstrap components

### 5. Ensure frontend component exists

- create `web` from manifest if missing
- for source-backed frontends, use source creation instead of image creation
- for package-backed frontends, use package upload instead of image creation
- for template-backed frontends, skip and report them as non-bootstrap components

### 5a. Converge package uploads before topology configuration

For every package-backed component, treat local preparation, event initialization, client HTTP upload, local cleanup,
remote status verification, and the final event-based create-or-replace action as one bounded workflow. Execute the
concrete contract in [40-source-and-package-rules.md](40-source-and-package-rules.md) before configuring ports, envs,
storage, dependencies, or deploy state for a newly created component. Existing components keep their current topology
and use `rainbond_replace_component_package` with the same `service_id`.

Convergence gates:
- `source.local_path` is client-local input and is read only by the local helper
- the initialization response must provide both `event_id` and the complete `upload_request`
- the local cleanup attempt happens immediately after the HTTP attempt, before any Rainbond Tool status or create call
- failed HTTP upload means local cleanup, remote upload-event deletion, and stop
- a successful HTTP response is not proof that Rainbond recorded the file; uploaded-file status must be non-empty before create-by-event
- empty status means remote upload-event deletion and stop
- only a successful create-by-event result makes a new component eligible for the remaining topology and deploy steps
- only a successful replace-by-event result with a build `event_id` starts existing-component convergence; wait for that
  build and verify health without recreating the component

### 6. Ensure minimum topology

- ensure dependencies exist from manifest `depends_on` with `rainbond_manage_component_dependency`
- apply the accepted provenance in parent `SKILL.md` **Always-on Guardrail 18**; dependency direction is always consumer `service_id` -> provider `dep_service_id`
- also wire topology edges such as `backend -> db` and `proxy/web -> backend` only when the edge is supported by manifest/Compose, env or config references, project documentation, current runtime evidence, or explicit user confirmation
- for every multi-component topology, build an explicit dependency checklist before handoff:
  - list provider components such as databases, caches, brokers, queues, search services, object storage, and backend/API services
  - list consumer components such as backend/API services, workers, frontends/proxies, admin consoles, dashboards, migration jobs, and management UIs
  - include edges declared in the manifest and accepted edges supported by README instructions, env/config references, proxy upstreams, runtime evidence, or explicit user confirmation; roles or image conventions alone are not evidence
  - query the current dependency summary before adding edges, add missing accepted edges, then query again to verify the visible Rainbond topology
- if the dependency tool reports `requires_open_inner`, open the target component's inner port or retry with `open_inner=true` and the target `container_port`
- do not report that Rainbond Tool lacks explicit dependency management; `rainbond_manage_component_dependency` is the explicit dependency management tool
- do not treat Nginx `proxy_pass`, application config hostnames, Kubernetes Service DNS, or manually written runtime envs as a replacement for a Rainbond dependency edge
- when adding a dependency to a middleware provider, prefer provider connection envs over duplicate consumer runtime envs
- set only the minimum frontend env required by the declared `access_mode`
- if a dependency target is source-backed and not yet converged, defer dependency creation until that target exposes usable runtime metadata
- if a consumer can start without its provider, do not use that startup success as proof the topology is complete; the accepted provider/consumer edge must still be present, deferred, or reported as a blocker

### 7. Deploy affected components

- deploy or restart only the components affected by creation or configuration changes

### 8. Run first-pass verification

- read app detail
- read summaries for all components
- for source-backed components or explicit build-failure questions:
  - read component events first
  - if events expose a failed build/deploy `event_id`, read the corresponding build log
  - read runtime logs only when build evidence no longer explains the failure
- read runtime logs for any abnormal component whose dominant issue is no longer a build problem
- for source-backed components, inspect recent events to determine whether the component is:
  - still building
  - compile-failed
  - waiting on unresolved runtime metadata

### 9. Decide whether to stop or hand off

- if frontend `access_mode` is unspecified, stop and hand off
- if source-backed components are still building or have compile/build failures, stop and hand off
- if there is a deeper runtime issue, hand off to `rainbond-fullstack-troubleshooter`
- if runtime components are converged and the remaining question is only user-facing access or delivery acceptance, hand off to `rainbond-delivery-verifier`
- if setup is structurally complete and frontend `access_mode` is specified, stop

## Build / Deploy Polling Discipline

Builds and deploys are slow and asynchronous. Java / CNB builds can take 2–5 minutes (JDK download + Maven dependencies + compile + image push). Reading status every iteration burns LLM iterations, multiplies tool-call cost, and crowds the message history without adding new evidence.

Apply this discipline whenever you are waiting on a build or deploy:

- Treat the same `event_id` as one polling target. Two consecutive reads of the same `event_id` (whether `rainbond_get_component_build_logs` or `rainbond_get_component_summary` against the same `service_id`) must be separated by meaningful new state — not just "let's check again".
- Cap polling: if four consecutive reads of the same `event_id` (or four consecutive same-status `rainbond_get_component_summary` reads on the same component) all show the same in-flight state, stop polling. Return a graceful intermediate reply to the user that says "build still in progress, expected ~N minutes; reply '继续' or 'check' to resume status check" and end the run.
- Do not bundle redundant reads in one iteration. Pulling `component_summary` + `pods` + `events` + `build_logs` together for the same component on the same iteration is almost always wasted; pick the single source that is most likely to have new information.
- A status worth re-reading is one where the state has likely changed: immediately after triggering `rainbond_operate_app`, after a manual approval was just granted, after a structurally relevant event (e.g., new `event_id`) appeared. "I want to see if it's done yet" alone is not a justification.
- If the user explicitly asks "看下进度", treat that as a single polling cycle and apply the same cap.
- When you stop polling and hand back to the user, include the latest `event_id`, the last observed phase, and a one-line "what should be true next" so the user can resume without re-explaining context.

This discipline keeps the run loop bounded for genuinely long-running builds. Failure to apply it is the dominant cause of "本次分析轮次已达上限" terminations on otherwise healthy build flows.

## Build Trigger Anchoring

Two concurrent builds on the same component produce two interleaved log streams that the user has to manually de-duplicate. Do not re-trigger `rainbond_build_component` unless the previous build's terminal state is known.

Capture every build trigger by `event_id`:
- `rainbond_create_component_from_source` returns the initial build `event_id` — record it as `build_event_id` immediately
- a later `rainbond_build_component` call returns a new `event_id` — overwrite `build_event_id` with the new value
- if the triggering response does not carry a usable `event_id`, record `trigger_at` and fall back to the most recent build event from `rainbond_get_component_events` for that `service_id`

`status = undeploy` in `rainbond_get_component_summary` is **runtime** state, not **build** state. It means no Pod is currently deployed for this component, and is consistent with:
- a source build still in progress that has not yet produced a deployable image
- a source build that failed downstream and never produced a Pod
- a component that was created but never built

`undeploy` is therefore **not** evidence that a fresh build is needed.

Before calling `rainbond_build_component` again on the same component:
- if `build_event_id` is known, confirm it is terminal via `rainbond_get_component_build_logs(event_id=build_event_id)` — look for `BUILD SUCCESS`, `BUILD FAILED`, or a fatal exit-code line
- if `build_event_id` was lost, read `rainbond_get_component_events` first; if the most recent build event is still in flight, treat that as the active build and wait — do not trigger a new one
- only call `rainbond_build_component` again when the previous build is terminal **and** one of the retry intents in [40-source-and-package-rules.md](40-source-and-package-rules.md) applies (source definition changed, build env tuned, explicit retry of same `git_url` + `code_version`)
- never call `rainbond_build_component` purely because `status = undeploy`, `status = waiting`, or because the runtime is "not running yet"; runtime labels are not build signals

When verifying a freshly created source-backed component:
- prefer reading the build log for the captured `build_event_id` over re-reading `component_summary`; the build is the dominant evidence until it is terminal
- only fall back to `rainbond_get_component_events` when `build_event_id` was lost or the build log stream is empty

## Source Build Convergence Before Dependency Completion

For source-backed components:
- create the component first
- trigger the source build/deploy flow
- then re-read component summary, component events, and build/runtime logs before completing downstream dependency wiring

If a source-backed component is still:
- `undeploy`
- `waiting`
- building
- or reporting compile/build failure

then:
- do not force downstream dependency creation that depends on unresolved port metadata
- keep the dependency intent as pending
- report the dependency as deferred, not ignored

Important:
- `web -> api` is still desired for topology visibility
- but it should be created only after `api` has converged enough for dependency creation to succeed

If source creation or source build fails:
- keep the component classified as source-backed in reasoning and output
- read component events first and extract the failed build/deploy `event_id` if one is present
- read the build event log before reading runtime container logs
- only switch to runtime logs when the build has already succeeded or the evidence has clearly shifted from build failure to startup/runtime behavior
- if the failure evidence points to source code, build output, or source metadata, hand off with `blocking_bucket = source build failed` or `next_handoff = code_build_handoff`
- if the build or pull failure evidence points to an unreachable third-party artifact, registry layer, package tarball, or GitHub Release asset, use `blocking_bucket = external artifact unreachable` and `next_handoff = code_build_handoff`
- if the failure evidence points to Rainbond Console, Rainbond Tool, or control-plane exceptions while creating the source component, use `blocking_bucket = platform backend issue` and `next_handoff = none`
- do not retry the same component through the image path unless the user explicitly changes the source definition
- do not retry the same component with a different Git branch or ref unless the user explicitly changes the source definition

## Package Upload Failure Convergence

Package upload is a pre-create transaction, not a partially healthy component state:
- if prepare or initialization fails, no package component was created; record it as skipped/waiting with the concrete local-helper or platform blocker
- if the HTTP upload fails, local cleanup and remote upload deletion must both be attempted before reporting the stop
- if upload status is empty, delete the remote event and stop instead of calling create-by-event
- do not deploy, wire dependencies to, or report a package component as created until event-based creation returns a component identity
- after event-based creation succeeds, use the normal component summary, event, build, and runtime evidence paths; do not repeat the upload merely because runtime convergence is still pending

## Deferred Dependency Recording

If a dependency is intentionally left incomplete because an upstream source-backed component has not converged yet:
- record it in prose
- record it in `deployment_plan.workflow.deferred_dependencies`
- describe the reason as `deferred_by_upstream_convergence`

Do not hide this state inside a generic “unhealthy” summary.
