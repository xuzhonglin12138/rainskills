## Verification Standard

`runtime_healthy` is a runtime conclusion, not a delivery conclusion.

A repair is only successful enough to hand off when:
- db is running and ready
- api is running and logs no longer show the dominant runtime blocker
- required dependency and ports are correctly configured
- no active source-build failure or capacity blocker still dominates the result
- the remaining question is delivery acceptance or user-facing URL validation, not further runtime repair

Do not declare repair success when:
- source-backed components are still building
- source-backed components have known compile or build failures
- required dependency edges are only pending because target components have not converged yet
- components are blocked by cluster scheduling or capacity constraints
- the dominant blocker has shifted to frontend access-path or build-layer work
- the same blocker bucket has already persisted after one repair-and-verify cycle in the current run

If the system is already `runtime_healthy`, stop and say so. Do not continue making changes.

## Output Format

Structured output is used only when the user or an automated evaluation explicitly requests it. Read the canonical [schema](../schemas/troubleshoot-result.schema.yaml) and generated [compact contract](generated/troubleshoot-contract.md) before constructing the final object.

The schema is the only authority for fields, required keys, types, and enums. This reference retains human-readable sections, consistency rules, and examples only. Append one final `### Structured Output` section with fenced `yaml`, and place no prose after it.

Consistency rules:
Consistency rules:
- every non-null `blocker_bucket` must include a canonical bucket, `dominant_evidence`, `stop_reason`, and `recommended_next_action`
- `source build failed` must use the evidence order `component_events -> build_logs` before any runtime-log reasoning
- `external artifact unreachable` must use event or pod evidence before runtime logs; use build logs for build-time downloads and pod detail/events for image-pull or registry-layer failures
- `cluster capacity blocked` must stop with `next_handoff = none` and `delivery_verifier_allowed = false`
- `code_or_build_handoff_needed` must stop with `next_handoff = code_build_handoff` and must not allow code edits, local tests, commit, or push
- `fallback_used` must be `false`; do not silently switch to package, image, or template paths
- `Verification Result` overall status in prose must match `runtime_state.label`
- if `runtime_state.label = runtime_healthy`, `next_handoff` may be `delivery_verifier` or `none`, but should normally be `delivery_verifier`
- if `runtime_state.label = code_or_build_handoff_needed`, `next_handoff` must be `code_build_handoff`
- if `runtime_state.label = capacity_blocked`, `next_handoff` must be `none`
- if `blocker_bucket = cluster capacity blocked`, `runtime_state.label` must be `capacity_blocked`
- if `blocker_bucket = source build failed`, `external artifact unreachable`, or `frontend access-path issue`, `runtime_state.label` must be `code_or_build_handoff_needed`
- if `runtime_state.label = topology_building`, do not claim key runtime errors are cleared unless fresh evidence proves it
- `actions_taken` must contain only actions actually taken in the current run; if no mutation happened, say so explicitly
- when a layer does not exist in the current topology, prose may say `not applicable` and the structured field should be `null`
- no secret values may appear in prose or structured output

    - Added the missing `api -> db` dependency with dependency management.
    - Redeployed `api` after dependency wiring.

### Problem Judgment
Root cause is `env naming incompatibility` based on logs and component configuration. Affected layers: `api`, `overall`.

### Actions Taken
- updated provider connection envs on `db` so dependents receive the expected DB_* contract
- added the missing `api -> db` dependency with dependency management
- redeployed `api` after dependency wiring

### Verification Result
- **db status**: `running`
- **api status**: `running`
- **frontend-access status**: `needs validation`
- **overall status**: `runtime_healthy`
- key error disappeared from logs: `yes`
- app can serve user-facing requests: `not yet verified from this run`

### Follow-up Advice
Short-term: hand off to `rainbond-delivery-verifier` to confirm final access outcome. Long-term: keep connection variables on the provider component so every dependent service receives the same contract. handoff needed: yes.

Only in explicit structured contract mode, respond using exactly these sections:

### Problem Judgment
- state the root cause clearly
- if inferred, say "based on logs and component configuration"
- specify which layer(s) are affected: db, api, frontend-access, overall
- if the current result is `topology_building`, `capacity_blocked`, or `code_or_build_handoff_needed`, say that explicitly here

### Actions Taken
- list the exact changes
- include env changes, dependency changes, port changes, and restart or deploy actions
- if no config change was applied, say so explicitly, for example: `- no changes applied; classified current blocker from fresh runtime evidence`

### Verification Result
Explicitly report four statuses:
- **db status**: `running` / `waiting` / `abnormal` / `capacity-blocked` / `not applicable`
- **api status**: `running` / `waiting` / `abnormal` / `capacity-blocked` / `not applicable`
- **frontend-access status**: `working` / `not working` / `needs validation` / `not applicable`
- **overall status**: `topology_missing` / `topology_building` / `runtime_unhealthy` / `runtime_healthy` / `capacity_blocked` / `code_or_build_handoff_needed`

Also:
- state whether the key error disappeared from logs
- state whether the app can serve user-facing requests or whether that still belongs to delivery validation

### Follow-up Advice
- separate short-term and long-term suggestions
- if a compatibility fix was used, recommend fixing variable compatibility in code or template later
- state handoff needed: yes or no
- if the blocker is cluster capacity, explicitly say application-level repair is paused until scheduling is restored
- if `topology_missing` is observed, explicitly say topology creation must be revisited before further troubleshooting

### Structured Output
- append a fenced `yaml` block as the final section
- render `TroubleshootResult`
- keep enum values and field names aligned with the schema above
- use canonical blocker buckets and runtime labels only
