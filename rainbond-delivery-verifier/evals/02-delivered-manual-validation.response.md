### Deployment State
The overall delivery outcome is `delivered-but-needs-manual-validation` for app `manual-demo`, environment `preview`. The final runtime state is `runtime_healthy`.

### Component Runtime
- `db status`: `running`
- `api/service status`: `running`
- `frontend status`: `running`

### Access URL
Preferred user-facing URL: `https://demo-team-us.rainbond.me/manual-demo`

### Verification Result
Verified Rainbond-side runtime convergence and resolved the preferred user-facing URL. External browser reachability was inferred from current evidence instead of directly checked from this run, so manual validation is still required.

### Next Step
manual URL validation

### Structured Output
```yaml
