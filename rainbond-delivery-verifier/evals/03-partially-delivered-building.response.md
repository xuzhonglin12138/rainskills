### Deployment State
The overall delivery outcome is `partially-delivered` for app `building-demo`, environment `preview`. The current runtime state is `topology_building`.

### Component Runtime
- `db status`: `running`
- `api/service status`: `building`
- `frontend status`: `waiting`

### Access URL
There is no usable access URL yet because the frontend is still waiting on upstream convergence.

### Verification Result
Current delivery evidence is inferred from Rainbond runtime and build state only. The dominant blocker is `source build still running`, so the rollout is not yet accepted as delivered.

### Next Step
run troubleshooter

### Structured Output
```yaml
